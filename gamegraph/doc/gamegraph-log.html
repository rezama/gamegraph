<h2>Project Log</h2>

<div style="width:600px;">

<h4>May 8, 2012, 2am</h4>
<p>Created new project "gamegraph"</p>

<h4>July 24, 2012, 2pm</h4>
<p>Working on the algorithm for generating the state transition graph.  Considered the two options of generating it deterministically by following all move outcomes or by just observing some random games.  Going for the second option for now, because existence of other non-deterministic variables like p and offset make the first option difficult.</p>

<h4>July 24, 2012, 4:30pm</h4>
<p>Implemented the on the fly graph generation algorithm.</p>

<h4>Aug 6, 2012, 8am</h4>
<p>Added graph_name parameter to the Experiment class and added support to other modules.</p>

<h4>Aug 20, 2012, 12:30am</h4>
<p> Added support for partially explored graph nodes: if the current graph
    node has no edges specified for the current roll, we declare the game a
    win for the other player.</p>
    
<p> Added support for storing the pos[] array in the graph nodes.</p>

<p> Added graph aware code to is_final() and has_player_won() methods.</p>

<p> Fixed a bug that caused incorrect recording of state transitions in the
    state graph (the current roll was lost after a call to
    self.switch_turn()).
    Fixed the organization of the move() methods in both domains.
</p>

<p> Added separate class variables RECORD_GAME_GRAPH and GAME_GRAPH.
    Changed NannonState and MiniGammonState to honor the is_state_based flag
    in more methods, namely the __str__(), __repr__(), and encode() methods

</p>

<p> Fixed bugs in state_graph.py with regard to the new roll parameter in
    methods.
</p>

<p> Changed StateGraph so that the nodes don't include the current dice
    roll.

<h4>Aug 20, 2012, 8pm</h4>
<p>Replacing the graph class with the igraph library</p>

<h4>Aug 21, 2012, 12:30am</h4>
<p>Replacing the graph class with the igraph library.  Ran some tests.  It seems the igraph library isn't any faster (if not slower) than my own graph class.  Reverted changes in minigammon.py.  Going to review and incorporate some of the useful changes tomorrow.  Also, can try to speed up my own graph code.</p>

<h4>missing some dates...</h4>

<h4>Aug 26, 2012, 12:30am</h4>
<p>Changed the back edge replacement algorithm to choose new successors only from the current successors of the node.  If no new successor is found the back edge is left untouched.</p>
