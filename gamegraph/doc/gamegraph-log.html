<h4>May 8, 2012, 2am</h4>
<p>Created new project "gamegraph"</p>

<h4>July 24, 2012, 2pm</h4>
<p>Working on the algorithm for generating the state transition graph.  Considered the two options of generating it deterministically by following all move outcomes or by just observing some random games.  Going for the second option for now, because existence of other non-deterministic variables like p and offset make the first option difficult.</p>

<h4>July 24, 2012, 4:30pm</h4>
<p>Implemented the on the fly graph generation algorithm.</p>

<h4>Aug 6, 2012, 8am</h4>
<p>Added graph_name parameter to the Experiment class and added support to other modules.</p>
